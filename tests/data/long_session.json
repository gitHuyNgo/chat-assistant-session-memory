        "content": "Attention in Transformers is a way for each token (word/subword) in a sequence to dynamically “look at” other tokens and decide how much each one should influence its representation. It’s basically a learned, content-based weighted averaging system: for every position, you compute a probability distribution over other positions and then take a weighted sum of their information. The key idea is that relationships between tokens (syntax, coreference, long-range dependencies, etc.) are not hard-coded by distance or recurrence; they are learned via these weights. I’ll go from intuition to math to implementation details, and then to multi-head, masking, complexity, gradients, and practical concerns."

        "content": "Backpropagation in Transformers with attention is not a different algorithm from standard backpropagation. It is still reverse-mode automatic differentiation on a computation graph. What is different is the structure of the graph, especially the softmax-based attention and the way gradients flow across tokens. That structural difference has important consequences for credit assignment, stability, and scaling."

I’ll be precise and skeptical where claims are often oversimplified. What both RNN and LSTM are trying to do Both are sequence models that process inputs one timestep at a time and maintain a hidden state intended to summarize the past."
